# Resume-Template
When you want a nice-looking resume and your a web developer, just make it with HTML and CSS. And that's exactly what I did. Leveraging the build speed of Vite and the power of Tailwind, I was able to design a stylish also, while using current cutting-edge web technologies such as Vite and Tailwind.

## Purpose
This project was just try out Tailwind after hearing about all of its hype. And, after trying it out, I would say it's well-worth the attention. The other purpose was to try Vite as my module-bundler. Needless to say, the speed and ease-of-use that it offered were unparalleled, especially compared to Create-React-App. This project left a big impression on me as I look forward to the ways front-end design will continue to evolve.
